# Next.js Starter Boilerplate with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint

This is a custom [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project template created with `nextjs-app`

## Getting Started

First, open the terminal:
```bash
npx nextjs-app projectname
```
alternatively, 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/create-nextjs-app.git
````
then `cd projectname` and run npm `install` then:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
